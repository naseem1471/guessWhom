          <h2>The future of Guess Whom?</h2>
          <h3>You will not get 24 image manipulations at this price</h3> 
         
          <p>There is really no reason why this should not be as popular as Monopoly, and many other games. Through the power of A.I we can harness photo techniques which would have taken so long and cost so much. We can do face swapping, all beauty filters, adjustment on all facial features, face merge, body merge, new backgrounds. A ton of filters ,and i'm not talking about the few you get free on your phone. </p>
          <p>So how does it work?</p>
          <p>Well you forward us the photographs, (they can be single individuals in each shot or multiple people in a photo, we can seperate them.) If the photo is only a partial photograph, the A.I can generate a full photograph from the partial photograph.</p>
          <p>How do I forward photographs? </p>
          <p> Well there are a number of ways. If your photographs are small in size then you could email them too me as atatchments. If they are larger in size, then you can use "DropBox", we will supply you a link. Thirdly if your photographs and images are on your phone you can use Whatapp, +44 7920 510 107. </p>
          <p>How much will it cost?</p>
          <p> Well, it's going to cost you an arm and a leg, not working for free you tosser. No seriously, we charge £55 for processing 24 photographs, if you already have a Guess Who? board at home,Fantastic. We can send out the images (gaurunteed post) and you are good to go. If you require a new board, then total cost will be £85 plus p+p.  </p>
          <p>What if I can't make up 24 photographs?</p>
          <p>Not to worry, we can add generic images as well to make up to 24.
           But really you should make up 24 easily. you have family, distant family, neighbours, any pets, office, work colleagues. Even people you really despise, we can make them in the image of something really despicable and you can have a good chuckle whenever you sit down to play.</p>
          <p>What else could I use the Guess Whom game for? </p>
          <p>There are many great and fun uses.</p>
          <p>There are office parties and gifts. Something to remind people of who they have been working with. Theres bully "Brian" everybody knows he's a cunt. what a great opportunity to show him in his true colors in the "Guess whom" game. All we require from you is a image, ( as stated before, does,nt matter if its a partial image). We also require a little backstory to give us an idea of his character. WE then feed the promps into the AI and see what it can randomly come up with. With photoshop to a certain extent we know what the end result will be. With AI manipulation, the end result can be different then what you expected. But sometimes thats makes the image more creative and original.</p>
